I'm a Machine Learning practitioner and researcher from :house: Bengaluru, India. Currently pursuing my B.Tech in CSE at IIIT Sri City, I'm passionate about solving challenging problems in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.

My experience spans from ML Research at Aalborg University to Data Science at ISRO, and now as an AI Engineer at Burni Consulting. I love working on innovative projects that push the boundaries of AI technology.

In my spare time, I enjoy working on self-projects, participating in hackathons, and exploring new domains. I'm always eager to collaborate on exciting AI projects and research initiatives.

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss ideas or collaborate on projects! 😄
