I'm a Machine Learning practitioner from :house: Bengaluru, India. I'm passionate about solving problems in AI and am currently building in stealth.

My experience spans from ML Research at Aalborg University to Data Science at ISRO, and now as an Software Engineer (ML) at a Stealth Startup. I love working on innovative projects that push the boundaries of AI or Web3 technology.

In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects, participating in hackathons, and exploring new domains. I'm always eager to collaborate on exciting projects and research initiatives.

Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss ideas or collaborate on projects! 😄
